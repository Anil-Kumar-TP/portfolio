My passion for Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) drives me to stay disciplined and physically fit. I train regularly, not only to maintain my physique but also to enhance my skills in this demanding sport.

This hobby has broadened my horizons and enriched my understanding of global narratives and filmmaking techniques.</p>
       <h4 class="tech">Tech</h4>
       <p class="interest-para" style="line-height: 1.4rem;">Beyond these activities, I have a keen interest in technology and innovation.
